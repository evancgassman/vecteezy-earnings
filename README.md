 //example.js
 
 const {getEarnings} = require("./index");
 async function main() {
   console.log(await getEarnings("username", "password"));
 }
 main();
```

## Using with PHP
```php
$earnings = shell_exec("node example 'username' 'password'");
//Ofcourse, you need to be in the proper directory. 
```
